## Overview of the Analysis
#### Purpose 
This site is created to display data gathered from UFO sightings in the United States and Cananda. When opened, the website shows the complete table of data. Once opened, users can read an introductory paragraph describing how useful it is for regular citizens to share and document their sightings as is shown in the data table. This work is meant to celebrate World UFO Day, bring awareness to UFO sightings, and help those who are studying UFOs to gather more information related to their work.  Users of the website can search and filter for multiple citeria, including the date of the sighting, city, state, country, and shape that may have been observed in the sighting. 

## Results
#### How to Search
First, let's take a look at the complete website, as pictured below. The layout is conducive to users being able to read some information about the data analysis done regarding UFO sightings in the top paragraph. When the website is opened, all data is automatically displayed in a table, with the filters and seach options to the left.

In order to filter and search the data table, the user can enter filter criteria for any of the filters displayed in the screenshot below. There are examples of the types of filters that can be added, and the format for the date (M/DD/YYYY), all shown in a light gray font in the search bar. Then, when the desired filter criteria has been entered, the user can click enter on their keyboard or use their cursor to click the "Filter Table" button on the bottom. This will show the data displayed on the table to the right with data that fits the criteria searched for.

## Summary
#### One drawback of this webpage
One drawback of this webpage is an element of the filter search. Although there are many options for filtering, the user needs to know the exact spelling and parameters of the data table to search. For example, the user may want to search for the town Edgartown, but may not know the exact spelling of the town, or may only remember the beginning part of the name of the town. The user may not know what kinds of shapes they can search for, which countries are included in the data, or how far back the dates for this data go. 

#### Two recommendations for further development
1. One recommendation for further development of this search engine would be to install a dropdown menu or picklist for each filter search bar. This way, the user can select from a list of options instead of having to remember the exact spelling or parameters. This would be a great option for the shape filter or country filter, since there are likely only a few shapes or countries that are included in the data. 
2. Another adjustment to the filters to deal with the spelling issue for cities, would be to have an auto-complete function set up for the city search bar. This would mean that, if a user knew that the beginning of the town they were looking for was "Edg..." they could type the first few letters and then the search bar would give the user suggestions of the cities that begin with those letters. This would also allow the user to know which cities are included so that they are not searching without any results for cities that are not included on the data.
